__What is CBOR__?  [CBOR](CBOR.md) ([RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)) is a binary data format inspired by JSON and MessagePack.  CBOR is used in [IETF](https://www.ietf.org) Internet Standards such as COSE ([RFC 8152](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152)) and CWT ([RFC 8392 CBOR Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8392)). WebAuthn also uses CBOR.

__Why this CBOR library?__ It doesn't crash and it has well-balanced qualities: small, fast, reliable and easy. 

* __Small__ and self-contained.  It has no external dependencies and no code gen. Programs in projects like cisco/senml are 4 MB smaller by switching to this library. In extreme cases programs can be smaller by 8+ MB.  See [comparisons](#comparisons).

* __Fast__ (esp. since v1.3). It solely uses safe optimizations.  Faster libraries will always exist, but speed is only one factor.  Choose this library if you value your time, program size, and system reliability. 

* __Reliable__ and safe. It prevents crashes on malicious CBOR data by using extensive tests, coverage-guided fuzzing, data validation, and avoiding Go's [`unsafe`](https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/) package.

* __Easy__ and saves time.  It has the same API as [Go](https://golang.org)'s [`encoding/json`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) when possible.  Existing structs don't require changes.  Go struct tags like `` `cbor:"name,omitempty"` `` and `` `json:"name,omitempty"` `` work as expected.

New struct tags like __`keyasint`__ and __`toarray`__ make CBOR, COSE, CWT, and SenML very easy to use.

Install with ```go get github.com/fxamacker/cbor``` and use it like Go's ```encoding/json```.

## Current Status
Version 1.x has:

* __Stable API__ – won't make breaking API changes.  
* __Stable requirements__ – will always support Go v1.12.  
* __Passed fuzzing__ – v1.3 passed 72+ hours of coverage-guided fuzzing.  See [Fuzzing and Code Coverage](#fuzzing-and-code-coverage).

Recent activity:

* [x] [Release v1.2](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- add RawMessage type, Marshaler and Unmarshaler interfaces.  Passed 42+ hrs of fuzzing.
* [x] [Release v1.3](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- faster encoding and decoding.
* [x] [Release v1.3](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- add struct to/from CBOR array (`toarray` struct tag) for more compact data.
* [x] [Release v1.3](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) -- add struct to/from CBOR map with int keys (`keyasint` struct tag). Simplifies using COSE, etc.
* [ ] [Milestone v1.4](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/milestone/3) -- 🎈 (maybe) Add support for CBOR tags (major type 6.)

## Design Goals 
This CBOR library was created for my [WebAuthn (FIDO2) server library](https://github.com/fxamacker/webauthn), because existing CBOR libraries didn't meet certain criteria.  This library became a good fit for many other projects.

This library is designed to be:

* __Easy__ – idiomatic API like `encoding/json` with identical API when possible.
* __Small and self-contained__ – no external dependencies and no code gen.  Programs in cisco/senml are 4 MB smaller by switching to this library. In extreme cases programs can be smaller by 8+ MB. See [comparisons](#comparisons).
* __Safe and reliable__ – no `unsafe` pkg, coverage >95%, coverage-guided fuzzing, and data validation to avoid crashes on malformed or malicious data.

Competing factors are balanced:

* __Speed__ vs __safety__ vs __size__ – to keep size small, avoid code generation. For safety, validate data and avoid Go's unsafe package.  For speed, use safe optimizations: cache struct metadata, bypass reflect when appropriate, use sync.Pool to reuse transient objects, and etc.
* __Standards compliance__ – support [CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049), including [canonical CBOR encodings](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-3.9) (RFC 7049 and [CTAP2](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html#ctap2-canonical-cbor-encoding-form)) with minor [limitations](#limitations). For example, negative numbers that can't fit into Go's int64 aren’t supported (like `encoding/json`.)

Initial releases focus on features, testing, and fuzzing.  After that, new releases (like v1.3) will also improve speed.

All releases prioritize reliability to avoid crashes on decoding malformed CBOR data. See [Fuzzing and Coverage](#fuzzing-and-code-coverage).

## Comparisons

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57072051/69281068-3e424680-0bad-11ea-97ab-730b3d3069af.png "CBOR library and program size comparison chart")

Programs like senmlCat in cisco/senml will be about 4 MB smaller by switching to this library.

Doing your own comparisons is highly recommended.  Use your most common message sizes and data types.

Additional comparisons may be added here from time to time (esp. speed comparisons!)

## Features

* Idiomatic API like `encoding/json`.
* Support "cbor" and "json" keys in Go's struct tags. If both are specified, then "cbor" is used.
* Encode using smallest CBOR integer sizes for more compact data serialization.
* Decode slices, maps, and structs in-place.
* Decode into struct with field name case-insensitive match.
* Support canonical CBOR encoding for map/struct.

* v1.2 -- `cbor.RawMessage` can delay CBOR decoding or precompute CBOR encoding.
* v1.2 -- User-defined types can have custom CBOR encoding and decoding by implementing `cbor.Marshaler` and `cbor.Unmarshaler` interfaces. 
* v1.3 -- add struct to/from CBOR array (`toarray` struct tag) for more compact data
* v1.3 -- add struct to/from CBOR map with int keys (`keyasint` struct tag). Simplifies using COSE, etc.
* [Milestone v1.4](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/milestone/3) -- (maybe) 🎈 add support for CBOR tags (major type 6.)

## Fuzzing and Code Coverage

Each release passes coverage-guided fuzzing using [fxamacker/cbor-fuzz](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor-fuzz).  Default corpus has:

* 2 files related to WebAuthn (FIDO U2F key).
* 3 files with custom struct.
* 9 files with [CWT examples (RFC 8392 Appendix A)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8392#appendix-A)
* 17 files with [COSE examples (RFC 8152 Appendix B & C)](https://github.com/cose-wg/Examples/tree/master/RFC8152).
* 81 files with [CBOR examples (RFC 7049 Appendix A) ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#appendix-A). It excludes 1 errata first reported in [issue #46](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/issues/46).

Unit tests include all RFC 7049 examples, bugs found by fuzzing, 2 maliciously crafted CBOR data, and etc.

Minimum code coverage is 95%.  Minimum fuzzing is 10 hours for each release but often longer (v1.3 passed 72+ hours.)

Code coverage is 97.8% (`go test -cover`) for cbor v1.3 which is among the highest for libraries of this type.

## Standards
This library implements CBOR as specified in [RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049), with minor [limitations](#limitations).

Three encoding modes are available since v1.3.1:
* default: no sorting, so it's the fastest mode.
* Canonical: [(RFC 7049 Section 3.9)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-3.9) uses length-first map key ordering.
* CTAP2Canonical: [(CTAP2 Canonical CBOR)](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html#ctap2-canonical-cbor-encoding-form) uses bytewise lexicographic order for sorting keys.

CTAP2 Canonical CBOR encoding is used by [CTAP](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html) and [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) in [FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) framework.

All three encoding modes in this library use smallest form of CBOR integer that preserves data.

## Limitations
🎈 CBOR tags (type 6) is being considered for a future release. Please let me know if this feature is important to you.

Current limitations:

* CBOR tags (type 6) are ignored.  Decoder simply decodes tagged data after ignoring the tags.
* CBOR negative int (type 1) that cannot fit into Go's int64 are not supported, such as RFC 7049 example -18446744073709551616.  Decoding these values returns `cbor.UnmarshalTypeError` like Go's `encoding/json`.
* CBOR `Undefined` (0xf7) value decodes to Go's `nil` value.  Use CBOR `Null` (0xf6) to round-trip with Go's `nil`.

Like Go's `encoding/json`, data validation checks the entire message to prevent partially filled (corrupted) data. This library also prevents crashes and resource exhaustion attacks from malicious CBOR data. Use Go's `io.LimitReader` when decoding very large data to limit size.

## System Requirements

* Go 1.12 (or newer)
* Tested and fuzzed on linux_amd64, but it should work on other platforms.

## Versions and API Changes
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), so the API is always backwards compatible unless the major version number changes.

## API 
The API is the same as `encoding/json` when possible.

In addition to the API, the `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags are worth knowing.  They can reduce programming effort, improve system performance, and reduce the size of serialized data.  

```
package cbor // import "github.com/fxamacker/cbor"

func Marshal(v interface{}, encOpts EncOptions) ([]byte, error)
func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error
func Valid(data []byte) (rest []byte, err error)
type Decoder struct{ ... }
    func NewDecoder(r io.Reader) *Decoder
    func (dec *Decoder) Decode(v interface{}) (err error)
    func (dec *Decoder) NumBytesRead() int
type EncOptions struct{ ... }
type Encoder struct{ ... }
    func NewEncoder(w io.Writer, encOpts EncOptions) *Encoder
    func (enc *Encoder) Encode(v interface{}) error
    func (enc *Encoder) StartIndefiniteByteString() error
    func (enc *Encoder) StartIndefiniteTextString() error
    func (enc *Encoder) StartIndefiniteArray() error
    func (enc *Encoder) StartIndefiniteMap() error
    func (enc *Encoder) EndIndefinite() error
type InvalidUnmarshalError struct{ ... }
type Marshaler interface{ ... }
type RawMessage []byte
type SemanticError struct{ ... }
type SyntaxError struct{ ... }
type UnmarshalTypeError struct{ ... }
type Unmarshaler interface{ ... }
type UnsupportedTypeError struct{ ... }
```
See [API docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/fxamacker/cbor) for more details.

## Installation
```
go get github.com/fxamacker/cbor
```
[Released versions](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor/releases) benefit from longer fuzz tests.

## Usage
👉 Like Go's `encoding/json`, data validation checks the entire message to prevent partially filled (corrupted) data. This library also prevents crashes and resource exhaustion attacks from malicious CBOR data. Use Go's `io.LimitReader` when decoding very large data to limit size.

Like `encoding/json`:

* cbor.Marshal uses []byte
* cbor.Unmarshal uses []byte
* cbor.Encoder uses io.Writer
* cbor.Decoder uses io.Reader

The `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags can reduce programming effort, improve system performance, and reduce the size of serialized data.

__Decoding CWT (CBOR Web Token)__ using `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags:
```
// Signed CWT is defined in RFC 8392
type signedCWT struct {
	_           struct{} `cbor:",toarray"`
	Protected   []byte
	Unprotected coseHeader
	Payload     []byte
	Signature   []byte
}

// Part of COSE header definition
type coseHeader struct {
	Alg int    `cbor:"1,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Kid []byte `cbor:"4,keyasint,omitempty"`
	IV  []byte `cbor:"5,keyasint,omitempty"`
}

// data is []byte containing signed CWT

var v signedCWT
if err := cbor.Unmarshal(data, &v); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Encoding CWT (CBOR Web Token)__ using `keyasint` and `toarray` struct tags:
```
// Use signedCWT struct defined in "Decoding CWT" example.

var v signedCWT
...
if data, err := cbor.Marshal(v); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Decoding SenML__ using `keyasint` struct tag:
```
// RFC 8428 says, "The data is structured as a single array that 
// contains a series of SenML Records that can each contain fields"

type SenMLRecord struct {
	BaseName    string  `cbor:"-2,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseTime    float64 `cbor:"-3,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseUnit    string  `cbor:"-4,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseValue   float64 `cbor:"-5,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseSum     float64 `cbor:"-6,keyasint,omitempty"`
	BaseVersion int     `cbor:"-1,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Name        string  `cbor:"0,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Unit        string  `cbor:"1,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Value       float64 `cbor:"2,keyasint,omitempty"`
	ValueS      string  `cbor:"3,keyasint,omitempty"`
	ValueB      bool    `cbor:"4,keyasint,omitempty"`
	ValueD      string  `cbor:"8,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Sum         float64 `cbor:"5,keyasint,omitempty"`
	Time        float64 `cbor:"6,keyasint,omitempty"`
	UpdateTime  float64 `cbor:"7,keyasint,omitempty"`
}

// data is a []byte containing SenML

var v []SenMLRecord
if err := cbor.Unmarshal(data, &v); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Encoding SenML__ using `keyasint` struct tag:
```
// use SenMLRecord struct defined in "Decoding SenML" example

var v []SenMLRecord
...
if data, err := cbor.Marshal(v); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

__Decoding__:

```
// create a decoder
dec := cbor.NewDecoder(reader)

// decode into empty interface
var i interface{}
err = dec.Decode(&i)

// decode into struct 
var stru ExampleStruct
err = dec.Decode(&stru)

// decode into map
var m map[string]string
err = dec.Decode(&m)

// decode into primitive
var f float32
err = dec.Decode(&f)
```

__Encoding__:

```
// create an encoder with canonical CBOR encoding enabled
enc := cbor.NewEncoder(writer, cbor.EncOptions{Canonical: true})

// encode struct
err = enc.Encode(stru)

// encode map
err = enc.Encode(m)

// encode primitive
err = enc.Encode(f)
```

__Encoding indefinite length array__:

```
enc := cbor.NewEncoder(writer, cbor.EncOptions{})

// start indefinite length array encoding
err = enc.StartIndefiniteArray()

// encode array element
err = enc.Encode(1)

// encode array element
err = enc.Encode([]int{2, 3})

// start nested indefinite length array as array element
err = enc.StartIndefiniteArray()

// encode nested array element
err = enc.Encode(4)

// encode nested array element
err = enc.Encode(5)

// end nested indefinite length array
err = enc.EndIndefinite()

// end indefinite length array
err = enc.EndIndefinite()
```

## Benchmarks

Go structs are faster than maps with string keys:
* decoding into struct is >31% faster than decoding into map.
* encoding struct is >33% faster than encoding map.

Go structs with `keyasint` struct tag are faster than maps with integer keys:
* decoding into struct is >25% faster than decoding into map.
* encoding struct is >31% faster than encoding map.

Go structs with `toarray` struct tag are faster than slice:
* decoding into struct is >15% faster than decoding into slice.
* encoding struct is >10% faster than encoding slice.

Doing your own benchmarks is highly recommended.  Use your most common message sizes and data types.
