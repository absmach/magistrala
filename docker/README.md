# Docker Composition

Configure environment variables and run Magistrala Docker Composition.

\*Note\*\*: `docker-compose` uses `.env` file to set all environment variables. Ensure that you run the command from the same location as .env file.

## Installation

Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Usage

Run the following commands from the project root directory.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

```bash
docker compose -f docker/addons/<path>/docker-compose.yml up
```

To pull docker images from a specific release you need to change the value of `MG_RELEASE_TAG` in `.env` before running these commands.

## Broker Configuration

Magistrala supports configurable MQTT broker and Message broker, which also acts as an events store. Magistrala uses two types of brokers:

1. MQTT_BROKER: Handles MQTT communication between MQTT adapters and message broker. This can either be 'VerneMQ' or 'NATS'.
2. MESSAGE_BROKER: Manages message exchange between Magistrala core, optional, and external services. This can either be 'NATS' or 'RabbitMQ'. This is used to store messages for distributed processing.

Events store: This is used by Magistrala services to store events for distributed processing. Magistrala uses a single service to be the message broker and events store. This can either be 'NATS' or 'RabbitMQ'. Redis can also be used as an events store, but it requires a message broker to be deployed along with it for message exchange.

This is the same as MESSAGE_BROKER. This can either be 'NATS' or 'RabbitMQ' or 'Redis'.  If Redis is used as an events store, then RabbitMQ or NATS is used as a message broker.

The current deployment strategy for Magistrala in `docker/docker-compose.yml` is to use VerneMQ as a MQTT_BROKER and NATS as a MESSAGE_BROKER and EVENTS_STORE.

Therefore, the following combinations are possible:

- MQTT_BROKER: VerneMQ, MESSAGE_BROKER: NATS, EVENTS_STORE: NATS
- MQTT_BROKER: VerneMQ, MESSAGE_BROKER: NATS, EVENTS_STORE: Redis
- MQTT_BROKER: VerneMQ, MESSAGE_BROKER: RabbitMQ, EVENTS_STORE: RabbitMQ
- MQTT_BROKER: VerneMQ, MESSAGE_BROKER: RabbitMQ, EVENTS_STORE: Redis
- MQTT_BROKER: NATS, MESSAGE_BROKER: RabbitMQ, EVENTS_STORE: RabbitMQ
- MQTT_BROKER: NATS, MESSAGE_BROKER: RabbitMQ, EVENTS_STORE: Redis
- MQTT_BROKER: NATS, MESSAGE_BROKER: NATS, EVENTS_STORE: NATS
- MQTT_BROKER: NATS, MESSAGE_BROKER: NATS, EVENTS_STORE: Redis

For Message brokers other than NATS, you would need to build the docker images with RabbitMQ as the build tag and change the `docker/.env`. For example, to use RabbitMQ as a message broker:

```bash
MG_MESSAGE_BROKER_TYPE=rabbitmq make dockers
```

```env
MG_MESSAGE_BROKER_TYPE=rabbitmq
SMQ_MESSAGE_BROKER_URL=${MG_RABBITMQ_URL}
```

For Redis as an events store, you would need to run RabbitMQ or NATS as a message broker. For example, to use Redis as an events store with rabbitmq as a message broker:

```bash
MG_ES_TYPE=redis MG_MESSAGE_BROKER_TYPE=rabbitmq make dockers
```

```env
MG_MESSAGE_BROKER_TYPE=rabbitmq
SMQ_MESSAGE_BROKER_URL=${MG_RABBITMQ_URL}
MG_ES_TYPE=redis
MG_ES_URL=${MG_REDIS_URL}
```

For MQTT broker other than VerneMQ, you would need to change the `docker/.env`. For example, to use NATS as a MQTT broker:

```env
MG_MQTT_BROKER_TYPE=nats
SMQ_MQTT_BROKER_HEALTH_CHECK=${SMQ_NATS_HEALTH_CHECK}
SMQ_MQTT_ADAPTER_MQTT_QOS=${SMQ_NATS_MQTT_QOS}
MG_MQTT_ADAPTER_MQTT_TARGET_HOST=${MG_MQTT_BROKER_TYPE}
MG_MQTT_ADAPTER_MQTT_TARGET_PORT=1883
MG_MQTT_ADAPTER_MQTT_TARGET_HEALTH_CHECK=${MG_MQTT_BROKER_HEALTH_CHECK}
MG_MQTT_ADAPTER_WS_TARGET_HOST=${MG_MQTT_BROKER_TYPE}
MG_MQTT_ADAPTER_WS_TARGET_PORT=8080
SMQ_MQTT_ADAPTER_WS_TARGET_PATH=${SMQ_NATS_WS_TARGET_PATH}
```

### RabbitMQ configuration

```yaml
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3.12.12-management-alpine
    container_name: magistrala-rabbitmq
    restart: on-failure
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE: ${MG_RABBITMQ_COOKIE}
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: ${MG_RABBITMQ_USER}
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: ${MG_RABBITMQ_PASS}
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST: ${MG_RABBITMQ_VHOST}
    ports:
      - ${MG_RABBITMQ_PORT}:${MG_RABBITMQ_PORT}
      - ${MG_RABBITMQ_HTTP_PORT}:${MG_RABBITMQ_HTTP_PORT}
    networks:
      - magistrala-base-net
```

### Redis configuration

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7.2.4-alpine
    container_name: magistrala-es-redis
    restart: on-failure
    networks:
      - magistrala-base-net
    volumes:
      - magistrala-broker-volume:/data
```

## Nginx Configuration

Nginx is the entry point for all traffic to Magistrala.
By using environment variables file at `docker/.env` you can modify the below given Nginx directive.

`MG_NGINX_SERVER_NAME` environmental variable is used to configure nginx directive `server_name`. If environmental variable `MG_NGINX_SERVER_NAME` is empty then default value `localhost` will set to `server_name`.

`MG_NGINX_SERVER_CERT` environmental variable is used to configure nginx directive `ssl_certificate`. If environmental variable `MG_NGINX_SERVER_CERT` is empty then by default server certificate in the path `docker/ssl/certs/magistrala-server.crt`  will be assigned.

`MG_NGINX_SERVER_KEY` environmental variable is used to configure nginx directive `ssl_certificate_key`. If environmental variable `MG_NGINX_SERVER_KEY` is empty then by default server certificate key in the path `docker/ssl/certs/magistrala-server.key`  will be assigned.

`MG_NGINX_SERVER_CLIENT_CA` environmental variable is used to configure nginx directive `ssl_client_certificate`. If environmental variable `MG_NGINX_SERVER_CLIENT_CA` is empty then by default certificate in the path `docker/ssl/certs/ca.crt` will be assigned.

`MG_NGINX_SERVER_DHPARAM` environmental variable is used to configure nginx directive `ssl_dhparam`. If environmental variable `MG_NGINX_SERVER_DHPARAM` is empty then by default file in the path `docker/ssl/dhparam.pem` will be assigned.
