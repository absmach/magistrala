###
# This docker-compose file contains optional InfluxDB, InfluxDB-writer and Grafana services
# for the Mainflux platform. Since this services are optional, this file is dependent on the
# docker-compose.yml file from <project_root>/docker/. In order to run these services,
# core services, as well as the network from the core composition, should be already running.
