## Introduction 📖

Magistrala is a distributed, highly scalable, and secure open-source cloud platform for messaging and event-driven architecture (EDA). It is a planetarily distributed, highly scalable, and secure platform that serves as a robust foundation for building advanced real-time and reactive systems.

## Why Magistrala Stands Out 🚀

Magistrala bridges the gap between various network protocols (HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP, and more) to provide a seamless messaging experience. Whether you're working on IoT solutions, real-time data pipelines, or event-driven systems, Magistrala has you covered. 🌐✨

## Key Features 🌟

- **Multi-Protocol Connectivity**: HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP, and more! 🌉
- **Secure by Design**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) with X.509 Certificates, JWT support, and multi-protocol authorization. 🔒
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Support for ABAC and RBAC policies. 📜
- **Multi-Tenant**: Manage multiple domains seamlessly. 🏢
- **Multi-User**: Unlimited organizational hierarchies for user management. 👥
- **Application Management**: Group and share messaging clients for streamlined operations. 📱
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and powerful communication channel management, grouping, and sharing. ✨
- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**: Scoped and revocable tokens for enhanced security. 🔑
- **Observability**: Integrated logging and instrumentation with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. 📈
- **Event Sourcing**: Build robust and scalable architectures. ⚡
- **Edge and IoT Ready**: Supports MQTT and CoAP protocols for seamless IoT gateway and sensor communication and management. 🌍
- **Developer-Friendly**: SDKs, CLI tools, and comprehensive documentation to get you started. 👩‍💻👨‍💻
- **Production-Ready**: Container-based deployment using Docker and Kubernetes. 🐳☸️

## Installation 🛠️

There are multiple ways to run Magistrala.
First, clone the repository and position to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/absmach/magistrala.git
cd magistrala
```

To run the latest stable (tagged) version, use:

```bash
# Run with latest stable tagged version
make run_stable
```

To run the latest version, use:

```bash
# Run with latest development version (from main branch)
make run_latest
```

The `make run_stable` command will:
- Checkout the repository to the latest git tag
- Update the version in the environment configuration
- Start the services with the stable release

**Note:** After running `make run_stable`, you'll be on a detached HEAD state. To return to your working branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

### Running on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs

When running Magistrala on Apple Silicon Macs, the Makefile will automatically detect your ARM64 architecture and build Docker images locally. 

**If using Docker Desktop:**

1. **Enable Apple Virtualization Framework**: In Docker Desktop, go to:
   - Settings → General → Enable "Use the new Virtualization framework"
   
2. **Enable Rosetta for x86_64 Emulation**: In Docker Desktop, go to:
   - Settings → General → Enable "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon"

After enabling these options, restart Docker Desktop, then run `make run_stable` or `make run_latest` as usual.

To manually run Magistrala, clone the repository and start all core services:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml --env-file docker/.env up
```

### Usage 📤📥

**Using the CLI :**

```bash
make cli
./build/magistrala-cli status
```

This command retrieves the status of the Magistrala server and outputs it to the console.

**Using HTTP with Curl :**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/status
```

This request fetches the server status over HTTP and provides a JSON response.

See our [CLI documentation](https://magistrala.absmach.eu/docs/dev-guide/cli/introduction-to-cli/) for more details.
